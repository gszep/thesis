abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) has become a routine tool for the computation of electronic structure in the physics, materials and chemistry fields. Yet the application of traditional DFT to problems in the biological sciences is hindered, to a large extent, by the unfavourable scaling of the computational effort with system size. Here, we review some of the major software and functionality advances that enable insightful electronic structure calculations to be performed on systems comprising many thousands of atoms. We describe some of the early applications of large-scale DFT to the computation of the electronic properties and structure of biomolecules, as well as to paradigmatic problems in enzymology, metalloproteins, photosynthesis and computer-aided drug design. With this review, we hope to demonstrate that first principles modelling of biological structure-function relationships are approaching a reality.},

abstract = {We present calculations of formation energies of defects in an ionic solid (Al2O3) extrapolated to the dilute limit, corresponding to a simulation cell of infinite size. The large-scale calculations required for this extrapolation are enabled by developments in the approach to parallel sparse matrix algebra operations, which are central to linear-scaling density-functional theory calculations. The computational cost of manipulating sparse matrices, whose sizes are determined by the large number of basis functions present, is greatly improved with this new approach. We present details of the sparse algebra scheme implemented in the ONETEP code using hierarchical sparsity patterns, and demonstrate its use in calculations on a wide range of systems, involving thousands of atoms on hundreds to thousands of parallel processes.},

abstract = {In situ optimization of a set of localized orbitals with respect to a systematically improvable basis set independent of the position of the atoms, such as psinc functions, would theoretically eliminate the correction due to Pulay forces from the total ionic forces. We demonstrate that for strict localization constraints, especially with small localization regions, there can be non-negligible Pulay forces that must be calculated as a correction to the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the ground state. Geometry optimization calculations, which rely heavily upon accurate evaluation of the total ionic forces, show much better convergence when Pulay forces are included. The more conventional case, where the local orbitals remain fixed to pseudo-atomic orbital multiple-$\zeta$ basis sets, also benefits from this implementation. We have validated the method on several test cases, including a DNA fragment with 1045 atoms.},

This new approach allows us to perform density-functional calculations by solving directly for ''nonorthogonal generalized Wan-nier functions'' rather than extended Bloch states. We outline the theory on which our method is based and present test calculations on a variety of systems. Comparison of our results with a standard plane-wave code shows that they are equivalent. Apart from the usual advantages of the plane-wave approach such as the applicability to any lattice symmetry and the high accuracy, our method also benefits from the localization properties of our functions in real space. The localization of all our functions greatly facilitates the future extension of our method to linear-scaling schemes or calculations of the electric polarization of crystalline insulators.},

abstract ={We studied the microsecond folding dynamics of three β hairpins (Trp zippers 1–3, TZ1–TZ3) by using temperature-jump fluorescence and atomistic molecular dynamics in implicit solvent. In addition, we studied TZ2 by using time-resolved IR spectroscopy. By using distributed computing, we obtained an aggregate simulation time of 22 ms. The simulations included 150, 212, and 48 folding events at room temperature for TZ1, TZ2, and TZ3, respectively. The all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLSaa) potential set predicted TZ1 and TZ2 properties well; the estimated folding rates agreed with the experimentally determined folding rates and native conformations were the global potential-energy minimum. The simulations also predicted reasonable unfolding activation enthalpies. This work, directly comparing large simulated folding ensembles with multiple spectroscopic probes, revealed both the surprising predictive ability of current models as well as their shortcomings. Specifically, for TZ1–TZ3, OPLS for united atom models had a nonnative free-energy minimum, and the folding rate for OPLSaa TZ3 was sensitive to the initial conformation. Finally, we characterized the transition state; all TZs fold by means of similar, native-like transition-state conformations.},

abstract = "The folding of a polypeptide from an extended state to a well-defined conformation is studied using microsecond classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations in explicit solvent and in vacuo. It is shown that the solvated peptide folds many times in the \{REMD\} simulations but only a few times in the conventional simulations. From the folding events in the classical simulations we estimate an approximate folding time of 1â2 ÎŒs. The \{REMD\} simulations allow enough sampling to deduce a detailed Gibbs free energy landscape in three dimensions. The global minimum of the energy landscape corresponds to the native state of the peptide as determined previously by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Starting from an extended state it takes about 50 ns before the native structure appears in the \{REMD\} simulations, about an order of magnitude faster than conventional MD. The calculated melting curve is in good qualitative agreement with experiment. In vacuo, the peptide collapses rapidly to a conformation that is substantially different from the native state in solvent. "

We consider methods based on collective variable biasing and on tempering, and offer both historical and contemporary perspectives. In collective-variable biasing, we first discuss methods stemming from thermodynamic integration that use mean force biasing, including the adaptive biasing force algorithm and temperature acceleration. We then turn to methods that use bias potentials, including umbrella sampling and metadynamics. We next consider parallel tempering and replica-exchange methods. We conclude with a brief presentation of some combination methods.},

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

abstract="Large-scale conformational transitions represent both a challenge and an opportunity for computational drug design. Exploring the conformational space of a druggable target with sufficient detail is computationally demanding. However, if it were possible to fully account for target flexibility, one could exploit this knowledge to rationally design more potent and more selective drug candidates. Here, we discuss how molecular dynamics together with free energy algorithms based on Metadynamics and Path Collective Variables can be used to study both large-scale conformational transitions and ligand binding to flexible targets. We show real-life examples of how these methods have been applied in the case of cyclin-dependent kinases, a family of flexible targets that shows promise in cancer therapy.",

	abstract = {When examining complex problems, such as the folding of proteins, coarse grained descriptions of the system drive our investigation and help us to rationalize the results. Oftentimes collective variables (CVs), derived through some chemical intuition about the process of interest, serve this purpose. Because finding these CVs is the most difficult part of any investigation, we recently developed a dimensionality reduction algorithm, sketch-map, that can be used to build a low-dimensional map of a phase space of high-dimensionality. In this paper we discuss how these machine-generated CVs can be used to accelerate the exploration of phase space and to reconstruct free-energy landscapes. To do so, we develop a formalism in which high-dimensional configurations are no longer represented by low-dimensional position vectors. Instead, for each configuration we calculate a probability distribution, which has a domain that encompasses the entirety of the low-dimensional space. To construct a biasing potential, we exploit an analogy with metadynamics and use the trajectory to adaptively construct a repulsive, history-dependent bias from the distributions that correspond to the previously visited configurations. This potential forces the system to explore more of phase space by making it desirable to adopt configurations whose distributions do not overlap with the bias. We apply this algorithm to a small model protein and succeed in reproducing the free-energy surface that we obtain from a parallel tempering calculation.},

abstract="The concept of memory has been introduced into a molecular dynamics algorithm. This was done so as to persuade a molecular system to visit new areas of conformational space rather than be confined to a small number of low-energy regions. The method is demonstrated on a simple model system and the 11-residue cyclic peptide cyclosporin A. For comparison, calculations were also performed using simulated temperature annealing and a potential energy annealing scheme. Although the method can only be applied to systems with a small number of degrees of freedom, it offers the chance to generate a multitude of different low-energy structures, where other methods only give a single one or few. This is clearly important in problems such as drug design, where one is interested in the conformational spread of a system.",

@article{trpNMR,
	Abstract = {We develop a coarse-grained protein model with a simplified amino acid interaction potential. Using this model, we perform discrete molecular dynamics folding simulations of a small 20-residue protein---Trp-cage---from a fully extended conformation. We demonstrate the ability of the Trp-cage model to consistently reach conformations within 2-{\AA}backbone root-mean-square distance from the corresponding NMR structures. The minimum root-mean-square distance of Trp-cage conformations in simulations can be <1 {\AA}. Our findings suggest that, at least in the case of Trp-cage, a detailed all-atom protein model with a molecular mechanics force field is not necessary to reach the native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success of folding Trp-cage in our simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular mechanics simulation studies may be mainly due to the special stabilizing features specific to this miniprotein.},

Acceleration of the dynamics is achieved by constructing a bias potential in terms of a patchwork of one-dimensional, locally valid collective coordinates. These collective coordinates are obtained from trajectory analyses so that they adapt to any new features encountered during the simulation. We show how this methodology can be used to enhance sampling in real chemical systems citing examples both from the physics of clusters and from the biological sciences.},

abstract ={A molecular dynamics-based protocol is proposed for finding and scoring protein-ligand binding poses. This protocol uses the recently developed reconnaissance metadynamics method, which employs a self-learning algorithm to construct a bias that pushes the system away from the kinetic traps where it would otherwise remain. The exploration of phase space with this algorithm is shown to be roughly six to eight times faster than unbiased molecular dynamics and is only limited by the time taken to diffuse about the surface of the protein. We apply this method to the well-studied trypsin–benzamidine system and show that we are able to refind all the poses obtained from a reference EADock blind docking calculation. These poses can be scored based on the length of time the system remains trapped in the pose. Alternatively, one can perform dimensionality reduction on the output trajectory and obtain a map of phase space that can be used in more expensive free-energy calculations.},

For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces.},

	abstract = {In this work, the favorable adsorption sites of aromatic compounds (ACs) on graphene oxide (GO) are characterized with both experimental and theoretical approaches. The results show that ACs exhibit a strong preference in adsorbing near the wrinkles and edges. Further analyses reveal that the edge-adsorption is mainly guided by the stronger π−π interaction near edges, accompanied by a stronger hydrogen bond interaction between carboxyl groups and ACs. Additionally, the water-mediated steric hindrance and ﬂexibility of carboxyl groups also contribute to the edge-adsorption. A higher density of atoms and electrons is the main mechanism for the wrinkle-adsorption, and structural investigations indicate that the roughness serving as a steric hindrance for the ACs migration also contributes to the wrinkle-adsorption. This wrinkle- and edge-adsorption pattern will shed light on the design of GO-related environmental materials.},

Patterns of the oxidized region and the morphological corrugation of the sheet strongly inﬂuence the spreading of water droplets with their lateral spans deﬁned by corresponding geometrical parameters and thus can be used to control their behavior on the surface.

	abstract = {Layer-by-layer assembled graphene oxide (GO) has been considered as a high-eﬃciency novel membrane material. However, its performance of water permeation and ion rejection remains largely unresolved. Herein we constructed a model of a GO membrane using laminate nanochannels with aligned ﬂexible multilayered GO sheets, on which functional groups were randomly distributed based on the Lerf−Klinowski model. The water permeation and ion rejection in the ﬂexible GO membranes with various pore widths and surface oxidization degrees were simulated. Our results indicate water ﬂow rate in the GO nanochannels is signiﬁcantly slowed, which is quantitatively equivalent with the prediction using the no-slip Poiseuille equation. The simulated results suggest the capillary channels within GO stacked laminated membranes might not always work as the major ﬂow route for water to permeate. It is observed that conﬁned water structure becomes more disordered and loose within the corrugated GO nanochannels. The interfacial friction provides huge corrugation of surface energy landscape for moving water and largely suppresses the water ﬂow. The microscopic mechanism of ion rejection has been ascribed to the size exclusion of ion hydration and the surface interaction from functional groups. Overall, our results provide new physical pictures for capillary channels in GO-related stacked membranes.},

We have carried out a comparative experimental and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study to uncover the mechanisms behind the aggregation and the surface activity of GO at diﬀerent pH values. At low pH, the carboxyl groups are protonated such that the GO sheets become less hydrophilic and form aggregates. MD simulations further suggest that the aggregates exhibit a GOÀwaterÀGO sandwichlike structure and as a result are stable in water instead of precipitating. However, at high pH, the deprotonated carboxyl groups are very hydrophilic such that individual GO sheets prefer to dissolve in bulk water like a regular salt. The GO aggregates formed at low pH are found to be surfaceactive and do not exhibit characteristic features of surfactant micelles. Our ﬁndings suggest that GO does not behave like conventional surfactants in pH 1 and 14 aqueous solutions. The molecular-level understanding of the solution behavior of GO presented here can facilitate and improve the experimental techniques used to synthesize and sort large, uniform GO dispersions in a solution phase.},

We have identiﬁed highly selective gas permeation that agrees with recent experimental measurements and is promising for advancing gas separation technologies such as hydrogen separation, helium/nitrogen generation, and CO2 sequestration. The roles of structural and chemical factors are discussed by considering diﬀerent types of gases including H2, He, CH4, N2, O2, CO, CO2, and H2O. The overall performance of graphene oxide membranes is also discussed with respect to their microstructures, and compared with recent experimental measurements. These understandings could advise high-performance gas-separation membrane development by engineering assemblies of two-dimensional layered structures.},

The model features both perpendicular and parallel water ﬂow across multiple sheets of pristine and/or oxidized graphene to simulate “brickand-mortar” microstructures. Additionally, regions of pristine/oxidized graphene overlap that have thus far been overlooked in the literature are explored. Diﬀerences in orientational and hydrogen-bonding features between adjacent layers of water in this mixed region are found to be even more prominent than diﬀerences between pristine and oxidized channels. This region also shows lateral water ﬂow in equilibrium simulations and orthogonal ﬂow in non-equilibrium simulations signiﬁcantly greater than those in the oxidized region, suggesting it may play a non-negligible role in the mechanism of water ﬂow across graphene oxide membranes.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to provide molecular insight into the aggregation process of graphene oxide (GO) in water. The aggregation was found to be a point−line−plane process. Five forces were involved during the process: van der Waals attraction, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen-bond interaction, π−π stacking, and the collision of water molecules. The dominant forces were diﬀerent in the three stages. The connection “line” was important to the aggregation process and the ﬁnal overlapping area of the GO aggregate. To study the eﬀect of oxygen content and functional group on the aggregation of GO, four diﬀerent GOs were used: C10O1(OH)1(COOH)0.5, C30O1(OH)1(COOH)0.5, C10O1(COOH)0.5, and C10O1(OH)1 (termed OGO, RGO, GO-COOH, and GO-OH, respectively). RGO aggregated faster than OGO, and GO-OH aggregated faster than GO-COOH. A quantitative analysis showed the diﬀerence in aggregation rate of these four GOs should be attributed to the hydrogen bonds. Additionally, the closer GOs were to each other initially, the faster they aggregated. This study reveals the aggregation process of GO and will be helpful in understanding its behavior in water.},

In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, the separation of CO2 and N2 through the interlayer gallery of GO membranes was studied. The preferential adsorption of CO2 in the GO channel derived from their strong interaction is responsible for the selectivity of CO2 over N2. Furthermore, the inﬂuences of interlayer spacing, oxidization degree, and channel length on the separation of CO2/N2 were investigated. Our studies unveil the underlying mechanism of CO2/N2 separation in the interlayer GO channel, and the results may be helpful in guiding rational design of GO membranes for gas separation.},

	abstract = {Graphene and its water-soluble derivative, graphene oxide (GO), have attracted huge attention because of their interesting physical and chemical properties, and they have shown wide applications in various ﬁelds including biotechnology and biomedicine. Recently, GO has been shown to be the most eﬃcient inhibitor for α-chymotrypsin (ChT) compared with all other artiﬁcial inhibitors. However, how GO interacts with bioactive proteins and its potential in enzyme engineering have been rarely explored. In this study, we investigate the interactions between ChT and graphene/GO by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We ﬁnd that ChT is adsorbed onto the surface of GO or graphene during 100 ns MD simulations. The α-helix of ChT plays as an important anchor to interact with GO. The cationic and hydrophobic residues of ChT form strong interactions with GO, which leads to the deformation of the active site of ChT and the inhibition of ChT. In comparison, the active site of ChT is only slightly aﬀected after ChT adsorbed onto the graphene surface. In addition, the secondary structure of ChT is not aﬀected after it is adsorbed onto GO or graphene surface. Our results illustrate the mechanism of the interaction between GO/ graphene and enzyme and provide guidelines for designing eﬃcient artiﬁcial inhibitors.},

Graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives have shown to modulate the aggregation pattern of disease causing amyloid beta (A␤) peptide. However, the mechanism is still not well understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the effect of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) having carbon:oxygen ratio of 4:1 and 10:1, respectively, on the conformational transitions (alpha-helix to beta-sheet) and the dynamics of the peptide was investigated. GO and rGO decreased the beta-strand propensity of amino acid residues in A␤. The peptide displayed different modes of adsorption on GO and rGO. The adsorption on GO was dominated by electrostatic interactions, whereas on rGO, both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions contributed in the adsorption of the peptide. Our study revealed that the slight increase in the hydrophobic patches on rGO made it more effective inhibitor of conformational transitions in the peptide. Alpha helix-beta sheet transition in A␤ peptide could be one of the plausible mechanism by which graphene oxide may inhibit amyloid ﬁbrillation.},

Lipid dip-pen nanolithography (L-DPN) is a method useful in generating supported membrane structures that maintain lipid functionality, such as exhibiting speciﬁc interactions with protein molecules. Here, we have integrated L-DPN, atomic force microscopy, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation methods to characterize the molecular properties of supported lipid membranes (SLMs) on graphene and graphene oxide supports. We observed substantial diﬀerences in the topologies of the stabilized lipid structures depending on the nature of the surface (polar graphene oxide vs nonpolar graphene). Furthermore, the addition of water to SLM systems resulted in large-scale reorganization of the lipid structures, with measurable eﬀects on lipid lateral mobility within the supported membranes. We also observed reduced lipid ordering within the supported structures relative to free-standing lipid bilayers, attributed to the strong hydrophobic interactions between the lipids and support. Together, our results provide insight into the molecular eﬀects of graphene and graphene oxide surfaces on lipid bilayer membranes. This will be important in the design of these surfaces for applications such as biosensor devices.},

We summarize the theoretical developments that enable the direct optimization of strictly localized quantities expressed in terms of a delocalized plane wave basis. These same localized quantities lead us to a physical way of dividing the computational effort among many processors to allow calculations to be performed efficiently on parallel supercomputers. We show with examples that ONETEP achieves excellent speedups with increasing numbers of processors and confirm that the time taken by ONETEP as a function of increasing number of atoms for a given number of processors is indeed linear. What distinguishes our approach is that the localization is achieved in a controlled and mathematically consistent manner so that ONETEP obtains the same accuracy as conventional cubic-scaling plane wave approaches and offers fast and stable convergence. We expect that calculations with ONETEP have the potential to provide quantitative theoretical predictions for problems involving thousands of atoms such as those often encountered in nanoscience and biophysics.},

	abstract = {We present an overview of the ONETEP program for linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with large basis set (planewave) accuracy on parallel computers. The DFT energy is computed from the density matrix, which is constructed from spatially localized orbitals we call Non-orthogonal Generalized Wannier Functions (NGWFs), expressed in terms of periodic sinc (psinc) functions. During the calculation, both the density matrix and the NGWFs are optimized with localization constraints. By taking advantage of localization, ONETEP is able to perform calculations including thousands of atoms with computational effort, which scales linearly with the number or atoms. The code has a large and diverse range of capabilities, explored in this paper, including different boundary conditions, various exchange–correlation functionals (with and without exact exchange), finite electronic temperature methods for metallic systems, methods for strongly correlated systems, molecular dynamics, vibrational calculations, time-dependent DFT, electronic transport, core loss spectroscopy, implicit solvation, quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical and QM-in-QM embedding, density of states calculations, distributed multipole analysis, and methods for partitioning charges and interactions between fragments. Calculations with ONETEP provide unique insights into large and complex systems that require an accurate atomic-level description, ranging from biomolecular to chemical, to materials, and to physical problems, as we show with a small selection of illustrative examples. ONETEP has always aimed to be at the cutting edge of method and software developments, and it serves as a platform for developing new methods of electronic structure simulation. We therefore conclude by describing some of the challenges and directions for its future developments and applications.},

Recent work questioning the applicability of Kohn–Sham density-functional theory to proteins and large water clusters (Rudberg 2012 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 24 072202) has demonstrated vanishing HOMO–LUMO gaps for these systems, which is generally attributed to the treatment of exchange in the functional used. The present work shows that the vanishing gap is, in fact, an electrostatic artefact of the method used to prepare the system. Practical solutions for ensuring the gap is maintained when the system size is increased are demonstrated. This work has important implications for the use of large-scale density-functional theory in biomolecular systems, particularly in the simulation of photoemission, optical absorption and electronic transport, all of which depend critically on differences between energies of molecular orbitals.},

We employ classical molecular dynamics simulations and largescale density functional theory calculations to investigate the effects of nanomaterials on the structure, dynamics and binding of an amyloidogenic peptide apoC-II(60-70). We show that the binding affinity of this peptide to carbonaceous nanomaterials such as C60, nanotubes and graphene decreases with increasing nanoparticle curvature. Strong binding is facilitated by the large contact area available for p-stacking between the aromatic residues of the peptide and the extended surfaces of graphene and the nanotube. The highly curved fullerene surface exhibits reduced efficiency for p-stacking but promotes increased peptide dynamics. We postulate that the increase in conformational dynamics of the amyloid peptide can be unfavorable for the formation of fibril competent structures. In contrast, extended fibril forming peptide conformations are promoted by the nanotube and graphene surfaces which can provide a template for fibril-growth.},

However, the standard of GO characterization is very poor because its structure is irregular, being sensitive to the preparation method, and it has a propensity to transform due to its reactive nature. Atomistic simulations of GO are common, but the nanostructure in these simulations is often based on little evidence or thought. We have written a computer program to generate graphene oxide nanostructures for general purpose atomistic simulation based on theoretical and experimental evidence. The structures generated oﬀer a signiﬁcant improvement to the current standard of randomly placed oxidized functional groups and successfully recreate the two-phase nature of oxidized and unoxidized graphene domains observed in microscopy experiments. Using this model, we reveal new features of GO structure and predict that a critical point in the oxidation reaction exists as the oxidized region reaches a percolation threshold. Even by a conservative estimate, we show that, if the carbon to oxygen ratio is kept above 6, a continuous aromatic network will remain, preserving many of graphene’s desirable properties, irrespective of the oxidation method or the size distribution of graphene sheets. This is an experimentally achievable degree of oxidation and should aid better GO synthesis for many applications.},

            The degree of oxidation of graphene oxide (GO) has been shown to be important for its toxicity and drug-loading efficiency. However, the effect of its variations on GO–protein interaction remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the effect of the different oxidation degrees of GO on its interaction with human ubiquitin (8.6 kDa) using solution state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with other biophysical techniques. Our findings show that the interaction between the protein and the different GO samples is weak and electrostatic in nature. It involves fast dynamic exchange of the protein molecules from the surface of the GO. As the oxidation degree of the GO increases, the extent of the interaction with the protein changes. The interaction of the protein with GO can thus be modulated by tuning the degree of oxidation. This study opens up new avenues to design appropriate graphenic materials for use in various biomedical fields such as drug delivery, biomedical devices and imaging.},

	abstract = {Functionalization of graphene is essential to interface it with other moieties to expand the scope of its electrical/electronic applications. However, chemical functionalization and/or molecular interactions on graphene sensitively modulate its electrical properties. To evaluate and take advantage of the properties of functionalized graphene, it is important to understand how its electrical attributes (such as carrier scattering, carrier concentration, charge polarity, quantum-capacitance enhanced doping, energy levels, transport mechanisms, and orbital hybridization of energy-bands) are influenced by a change in carbon's structural conformation, hybridization state, chemical potential, local energy levels, and dopant/interface coupling induced via functionalization or molecular interactions. Here, a detailed and integrated model describes factors influencing these electrical characteristics of functionalized graphene (covalent bonds, adsorption, π–π bonds, and lattice incorporation). The electrical properties are governed via three mechanisms: (a) conversion of carbon's hybridized state, (b) dipole interactions enhanced via quantum capacitance, and (c) orbital hybridization with an interfacing molecule. A few graphenic materials are also identified where further studies are essential to understand the effect of their functionalization.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the cholesterol-induced stability of lipid membranes during lipid peroxidation offers an explanation for the observed selectivity of plasma treatments towards cancer cells.
          , 
            We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of lipid peroxidation products on the structural and dynamic properties of the cell membrane. Our simulations predict that the lipid order in a phospholipid bilayer, as a model system for the cell membrane, decreases upon addition of lipid peroxidation products. Eventually, when all phospholipids are oxidized, pore formation can occur. This will allow reactive species, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), to enter the cell and cause oxidative damage to intracellular macromolecules, such as DNA or proteins. On the other hand, upon increasing the cholesterol fraction of lipid bilayers, the cell membrane order increases, eventually reaching a certain threshold, from which cholesterol is able to protect the membrane against pore formation. This finding is crucial for cancer treatment by plasma technology, producing a large number of RONS, as well as for other cancer treatment methods that cause an increase in the concentration of extracellular RONS. Indeed, cancer cells contain less cholesterol than their healthy counterparts. Thus, they will be more vulnerable to the consequences of lipid peroxidation, eventually enabling the penetration of RONS into the interior of the cell, giving rise to oxidative stress, inducing pro-apoptotic factors. This provides, for the first time, molecular level insight why plasma can selectively treat cancer cells, while leaving their healthy counterparts undamaged, as is indeed experimentally demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) constituted by claudin-5 tight junctions is critical in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system, but this highly selective molecular interface is an impediment for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. Therapeutic strategies that can exploit the paracellular transport remain elusive due to lack of molecular insights of the tight junction assembly. This study focuses on analyzing the membrane driven cis interactions of claudin-5 proteins in the formation of the BBB tight junctions. We have adopted a synergistic approach employing in silico multiscale dynamics and in vitro cross-linking experiments to study the claudin-5 interactions. Long time scale simulations of claudin-5 monomers, in seven diﬀerent lipid compositions, show formation of cis dimers that subsequently aggregate into strands. In vitro formaldehyde cross-linking studies also conclusively show that cis-interacting claudin-5 dimers cross-link with short methylene spacers. Using this synergistic approach, we have identiﬁed ﬁve unique dimer interfaces in our simulations that correlate with the cross-linking experiments, four of which are mediated by transmembrane (TM) helices and the other mediated by extracellular loops (ECL). Potential of mean force calculations of these ﬁve dimers revealed that the TM mediated interfaces, which can have distinctive leucine zipper interactions in some cases, are more stable than the ECL mediated interface. Additionally, simulations show that claudin-5 dimerization is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the lipid microenvironment. This study captures the fundamental interactions responsible for the BBB tight junction assembly and oﬀers a framework for extending this work to other tight junctions found in the body.},

	abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by specialized tight junctions between endothelial cells that line brain capillaries to create a highly selective barrier between the brain and the rest of the body. A major problem to overcome in drug design is the ability of the compound in question to cross the BBB. Neuroactive drugs are required to cross the BBB to function. Conversely, drugs that target other parts of the body ideally should not cross the BBB to avoid possible psychotropic side effects. Thus, the task of predicting the BBB permeability of new compounds is of great importance. Two gold-standard experimental measures of BBB permeability are logBB (the concentration of drug in the brain divided by concentration in the blood) and logPS (permeability surface-area product). Both methods are time-consuming and expensive, and although logPS is considered the more informative measure, it is lower throughput and more resource intensive. With continual increases in computer power and improvements in molecular simulations, in silico methods may provide viable alternatives. Computational predictions of these two parameters for a sample of 12 small molecule compounds were performed. The potential of mean force for each compound through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer is determined by molecular dynamics simulations. This system setup is often used as a simple BBB mimetic. Additionally, one-dimensional position-dependent diffusion coefﬁcients are calculated from the molecular dynamics trajectories. The diffusion coefﬁcient is combined with the free energy landscape to calculate the effective permeability (Peff) for each sample compound. The relative values of these permeabilities are compared to experimentally determined logBB and logPS values. Our computational predictions correlate remarkably well with both logBB (R2 ¼ 0.94) and logPS (R2 ¼ 0.90). Thus, we have demonstrated that this approach may have the potential to provide reliable, quantitatively predictive BBB permeability, using a relatively quick, inexpensive method.},

              The aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides into toxic β-sheet-rich oligomers, protofibrils and mature fibrils is the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the β-sheet formation and fibrillization of Aβ peptides is considered an important treatment strategy for AD. Graphene oxide (GO) has attracted particular interest in the anti-aggregation of amyloid proteins due to its good ability of crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB), low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. Recent experiments reported that GO nanosheets could strongly inhibit the fibril formation of Aβ
              1–42
              and reduce its cytotoxicity. However, the mechanism of suppressing Aβ
              1–42
              fibrillization by GO nanosheets is not well understood. Aβ
              1–42
              dimer is the smallest toxic oligomer of Aβ
              1–42
              aggregation. As a starting step to understand the inhibitory effect of GO nanosheets towards Aβ
              1–42
              aggregation, we investigated the conformational distribution of the Aβ
              1–42
              dimer with or without GO nanosheets by performing explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations showed that Aβ
              1–42
              peptides could form diverse β-sheet rich dimeric conformations, whereas those conformations were significantly inhibited after the addition of GO nanosheets. We found that GO suppressed the β-sheet formation of Aβ
              1–42
              mostly by weakening inter-peptide interactions mostly
              via

              1–42
              also play a role in the inhibition of Aβ aggregation. This study provides mechanistic insights into Aβ

Here, electronic correlation effects in the functional site of hemocyanin are investigated using a novel approach, treating the localised copper 3d electrons with cluster dynamical mean field theory. This enables us to account for dynamical and multi-reference quantum mechanics, capturing valence and spin fluctuations of the 3d electrons. Our approach explains the stabilisation of the experimentally observed di-Cu singlet for the butterflied \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Cu\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{O\}\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$Cu2O2 core, with localised charge and incoherent scattering processes across the oxo-bridge that prevent long-lived charge excitations.

	abstract = {Graphene nanosheet has exhibited an increasing prospect in various biomedical applications because of its extraordinary properties. Meanwhile, recent experiments have shown that graphene has antibacterial activity or cytotoxicity and can cause cell membrane damage. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the interactions between graphene and cell membrane to avoid its adverse eﬀects. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulation to explore these interactions. The results show that pristine graphene (PG) can readily penetrate into the bilayer and has no eﬀect on the integrity of membrane. When graphene oxide (GO) is embedded in the membrane, several lipids are pulled out of the membrane to the surface of GO, resulting in the pore formation and water molecules ﬂowing into the membrane. The diﬀerence between PG and GO in the membrane originates from GO’s oxygen-contained groups, which enhance the adsorption of the lipids on GO surface. However, the main interactions between GO and membrane are still determined by the strong dispersion interactions between its hydrophobic domains and the lipid tails of the bilayer. Therefore, the toxicity of coated GO can be weakened, since its hydrophobic domains are screened by polymers. The ﬁndings may oﬀer new perspective for better designing GO based nanocarrier or antibiotics and other biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Graphite oxide (GO) and its derivatives have been studied using 13C and 1H NMR. NMR spectra of GO derivatives confirm the assignment of the 70 ppm line to C-OH groups and allow us to propose a new structural model for GO. Thus we assign the 60 ppm line to epoxide groups (1,2-ethers) and not to 1,3- ethers, as suggested earlier, and the 130 ppm line to aromatic entities and conjugated double bonds. GO contains two kinds of regions: aromatic regions with unoxidized benzene rings and regions with aliphatic six-membered rings. The relative size of the two regions depends on the degree of oxidation. The carbon grid is nearly flat; only the carbons attached to OH groups have a slightly distorted tetrahedral configuration, resulting in some wrinkling of the layers. The formation of phenol (or aromatic diol) groups during deoxygenation indicates that the epoxide and the C-OH groups are very close to one another. The distribution of functional groups in every oxidized aromatic ring need not be identical, and both the oxidized rings and aromatic entities are distributed randomly.},

We have carried out a comparative experimental and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study to uncover the mechanisms behind the aggregation and the surface activity of GO at different pH values. At low pH, the carboxyl groups are protonated such that the GO sheets become less hydrophilic and form aggregates. MD simulations further suggest that the aggregates exhibit a GO–water–GO sandwichlike structure and as a result are stable in water instead of precipitating. However, at high pH, the deprotonated carboxyl groups are very hydrophilic such that individual GO sheets prefer to dissolve in bulk water like a regular salt. The GO aggregates formed at low pH are found to be surface-active and do not exhibit characteristic features of surfactant micelles. Our findings suggest that GO does not behave like conven...},

abstract = {A study of the local structure of graphene oxide is presented. Graphene oxide is understood to be partially oxidized graphene. Absorption peaks corresponding to interlayer states suggest the presence of pristine graphitic nanoislands in graphene oxide. Site-projected partial density of states of carbon atoms bonded to oxygen atoms suggests that the broadening of the peak due to interlayer states in the carbon K-edge spectrum of graphene oxide is predominantly due to formation of epoxide linkages. Density functional theory suggests that multilayers of graphene oxide are linked by peroxide-like linkages.},
