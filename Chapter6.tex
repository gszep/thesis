\chapter{Superexchange mechanism and quantum manybody excitations in the archetypal di-Cu oxo-bridge}
\label{Hemocyanin}
\vspace{-1cm}

In this work, we study the electronic structure of the hemocyanin protein, where in particular we study the 59-atom protein core using density functional theory + dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT). Here, we find that the hemocyanin protein utilises electronic correlation effects in performing its function of oxygen transport. By treating the copper 3\textit{d} electrons in the hemocyanin functional site using DMFT, we recover experimentally observed singlet electronic ground state. This work allows the transferability of the DFT+DMFT approach to the quantum treatment of the entire protein, using linear-scaling DFT. The importance of accurate simulation of the Hemocyanin core is in understanding how biological systems have evolved to function through quantum biology, as well as its use in biomimetic applications in engineering.\cite{al2020superexchange} \edit{Contributions for this work are as follows: \textbf{Cedric Weber} and \textbf{Mohamed Ali al-Badri} conceived and planned the research. \textbf{Mohamed Ali al-Badri, Edward Linscott} and \textbf{Cedric Weber} performed the calculations. \textbf{Mohamed Ali al-Badri

     3, figure, {\textbf{The superexchange model of Metz and Solomon.} The Cu$_2$O$_2$ core is depicted from side-on (a,c) and above (b,d). In the planar configuration (a,b), single-ligand orbitals bridge the two copper sites, and superexchange is possible. In a bent configuration (c,d), the copper \textit{d} orbitals overlap with different $\pi^{\ast}$ orbitals. As these two sets of orbitals are orthogonal, hopping between the blue and the red subspaces is not possible and the superexchange mechanism breaks down.},cc,
