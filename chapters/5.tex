\section{Preface}
\subsection{Problem Statement \& Context}
The studies in chapters \ref{chapter:double-exclusive}--\ref{chapter:inference} were carried out under the assumption that the underlying microscopic mechanisms that give rise to different phenotypes of an organism are known, and therefore can be modelled with differential equations that have interpretable parameters $\theta$. In section \ref{section:phenotype-inference} we outlined some popular machine learning approaches that can be used in settings where the underlying mechanism is partially or completely unknown. This chapter presents a study in immunology. While detailed models of the immune system exist \cite{Eftimie2016MathematicalDirections}, in the advent of high-throughput biology new mechanisms and exceptions are continuously being discovered \cite{Varade2020HumanChallenges}. This is done by identifying immune cell populations, their function and mechanism of action from tissue and blood samples taken from an organism in homeostasis. \emph{Immunophenotyping} methods use antibodies to identify cells based on the types of antigens or markers on their surface. As we shall see, such datasets are typically high-dimensional data clouds that can be reduced with the help of \emph{universal function approximators} and clustered to identify different immune cell phenotypes. Such high-dimensional data clouds also appear in chapter \ref{chapter:inference} when optimal parameters $\theta$ reveal clusters of topologically or geometrically equivalent models.

In this chapter we argue the importance of interactive tools that allow immunologists to navigate high-dimensional data clouds from heterogeneous experimental setups. Such tools enable crowd-sourced consensus phenotyping of cell populations, discovery of rare populations and iterative refinement of a model of the immune system. An interactive tool \emph{FlowAtlas.jl} is presented in an adaptation of a manuscript prepared for \emph{Nature Methods: Brief Communications} at the time of writing the thesis. We conclude this chapter with a vision of how approaches in chapters \ref{chapter:inference} and \ref{chapter:exploring} can be combined to realise a high-throughput \emph{Design-Learn} pipeline.

\section{Introduction}
Rapid advancements in flow and mass cytometry have brought about a new era of high-dimensional cell phenotyping. However, new algorithms and computational methods for dealing with high-dimensional data are typically not accompanied by user-friendly, flexible and interactive analysis tools. The wider biomedical research community relies on intuitive and transparent analysis for reaching consensus on discoveries. The uptake of currently available computational tools by biologists remains low, likely due to the lack of inter-operability with familiar platforms such as FlowJo and high entry requirements for computational literacy. Here we introduce FlowAtlas -- our effort to address the following issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing insights from immunophenotyped datasets from heterogeneous experimental designs is difficult
    \item Navigating high-dimensional data in well-established tools like FlowJo or FCSExpress is difficult
    \item Limited computational resources require down-sampling data that may contain rare populations
    \item Pipelines built in scripting languages like R or Python have limited inter-operability with FlowJo
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:flow-atlas}
\end{Figure}

We showcase the capabilities of FlowAtlas using a novel human flow cytometry dataset consisting of immune cells extracted from the tissues of five deceased organ donors. Immunophenotyping was performed using three slightly different antibody panels (see Extended Tables \ref{table:donors}--\ref{table:panels} for donor metadata and panel information) representing heterogeneity in experimental design that is typical across multiple datasets. FlowAtlas was designed for use in an iterative discovery loop with FlowJo, where traditional FlowJo gating strategies provide initial annotation of main cell populations, conditions, and sample grouping to guide the discovery of new sub-populations. With the help of high-performance library \texttt{GigaSOM.jl} \cite{Kratochvil2018RapidEmbedSOM} we can perform a two dimensional embedding of high-dimensional datasets without down-sampling. The scatter visualisation methods from \texttt{GigaSOM.jl} were exposed to a browser front-end with interactive library OpenLayers \cite{2006OpenLayers}. This enabled the visual exploration and profiling of hundreds of millions of cells. By imputing missing values before dimensionality reduction, using random sampling with replacement, datasets acquired using non-identical antibody panels can be integrated and analysed together. To remove any biases induced by algorithms or data processing, the imputed values are neither visualised nor included in any downstream analysis and only statistics on the original raw data are computed.

\section{Proposed Method}

\subsection{Pre-processing}
Anomaly filtering was performed using FlowAI \cite{GianniMonaco2017FlowAI}. Acquisition anomalies result from sudden flow rate or signal acquisition instability and induce undesired spearing in population distributions. Filtered files are imported into FlowJo for data pre-processing: quality control of compensation matrices and gating of live lymphocytes using forward, side scatter and zombie dye channels. The live lymphocytes are exported as a new files, reducing the file size by approximately 40\%. This substantially shortens the computationally expensive embedding time. FlowJo is then used to annotate channels and resolve discrepancies between channel names defined at acquisition time from different panels. In our dataset, for example, some samples only had the signal from FoxP3 and others had both FoxP3 and IgM markers in one channel. By renaming FoxP3 to FoxP3-IgM in the relevant samples in FlowJo we can analyse both sample sets together in FlowAtlas. Missing channels between datasets are respected and are imputed only for the purposes of calculating the embedding. The imputation does not affect any downstream analysis.
\subsection{Annotation in FlowJo}
Hierarchical gating strategies (Figure \ref{fig:gating}) are used to annotate known populations of interest. These strategies can differ between samples and panels as long as gates that define the same phenotype are given the same name. Cells that fall outside of the gating strategy are annotated as \textit{unlabelled} in FlowAtlas and can still be explored. The filters that can be used to navigate and colour-code the embedding are defined by the sample group names in FlowJo. In this dataset each sample is allocated to two groups: one telling us which tissues the sample came from, the other identifies the donor. By default groups are interpreted as different \textit{conditions} of a sample, unless the group name contains numbers, in which case the group is interpreted as a \textit{batch}. The user can rename and re arrange groups in FlowAtlas. In our dataset the \textit{conditions} are different tissues and \textit{batches} are different donors.

Any or all of the following channels (highlighted in orange) may be missing due to heterogeneous panel design: CD19, IgD and CD45}
    \label{fig:gating}
\end{Figure}
\subsection{Exploration in FlowAtlas.jl}
The information from the FlowJo workspace is loaded parsed by FlowAtlas. Individual files are merged into one table and missing values are imputed for the purpose of the embedding. The embedding mapping is cached in file named with a \texttt{.som} extension. The same mapping can be used for different datasets as long as the channel names and the total number of channels match. To re-calculate the mapping simply delete the cache file. Sharing the cache file together with the FlowJo workspace and FCS files allows colleagues to work on the same embedding to verify findings in a reproducible manner. The graphical user interface has a map of the two dimensional embedding that was obtained by dimensionality reduction with EmbedSOM \cite{Kratochvil2020GigaSOM.jl:Datasets}. The map can be zoomed and panned and is rendered efficiently using OpenLayers \cite{2006OpenLayers}. The left-hand panel menu was designed with D3.js \cite{2011D3.js} and has four tabs: \textit{Annotations}, \textit{Expression}, \textit{Frequency} and \textit{Settings}. The \textit{Annotations} tab allows the user to filter and colour the embedding by marker expression, population, condition and batch information imported from FlowJo. The conditions and batches can also be re defined here. The \textit{Expression} tab has a polygon draw tool that enables gating populations directly in the embedding filtered by settings in the \textit{Annotations} tab. The gates produce violin plots that reveal fluorescence distributions across all markers. By clicking the violins it is possible to re-colour the gates to for a differential expression analysis. The \textit{Frequency} tab generates box plots showing relative abundance of selected populations and conditions relative to any set of parent populations. The parental population, the \textit{conditions} axis and \textit{batch} marker colours are defined by settings in the \textit{Annotations} tab. Unique sub-populations identified in FlowAtlas can then be validated in FlowJo. This iterative discovery loop simplifies the identification of rare or novel cell populations that may otherwise be missed by data down-sampling or under-fitting in existing unsupervised clustering approaches.
\section{Results}
It has become common-place in single cell analysis publications to include a two dimensional embedding that reveals different cell phenotypes as clusters in the scatter plot. While providing a good global overview of the dataset, such static images are difficult to interrogate for batch variance and possible subset structures that may imply there are unlabelled phenotypes present that were not captured by the gating strategy (Figure \ref{fig:gating}). FlowAtlas provides an interactive interface for filtering, colouring and zooming into an embedding to for efficient phenotype discovery. By filtering and colouring by batch, it is possible to readily identify batch effects and subsets that are conserved across batches (Figure \ref{fig:treg-batches}). 
\begin{Figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{treg-batches}
    \caption{Detecting batch variance within regulatory helper phenotype. \textbf{a} Regulatory to helper ratio by tissue aggregated over batches reveals enrichment in lymph nodes and blood. \textbf{b} Self-organised map embedding of all regulatory cells coloured by Helios expression. A region of high Helios expression can be identified and zoomed, in searched for subsets. \textbf{c} Embedding coloured and filtered by different batches to identify conserved subsets. Fluorescence distributions reveal missing channels and batch effects.}
    \label{fig:treg-batches}
\end{Figure}
Once the subsets conserved across batches have been identified they can be gated directly in the embedding (Figure \ref{fig:treg-discovery}). Filtering the embedding by tissue will give us an initial estimate for the relative abundance of the newly identified subsets. The fluorescence distributions for each gate will guide additions to the gating strategy in FlowJo.

    \label{fig:treg-discovery}
\end{Figure}

\subsection{Regulatory Helper Subsets}
Regulatory T helper cells suppress immune response and thereby maintain homeostasis and self-tolerance. It has been shown that regulatory helpers are able to inhibit T cell proliferation and cytokine production and play a critical role in preventing autoimmunity \cite{Kondelkova2010RegulatoryDisorders}.

Regulatory helpers were enriched in mesenteric lymph nodes accounting for more than 20\% of all helper cells across all donors (Figure \ref{fig:treg-batches}a). Colouring the embedding of regulatory helper cells by the expression of the Ikaros family transcription factor Helios (Figure \ref{fig:treg-batches}b) revealed Helios$^+$ and Helios$^-$ subsets as expected \cite{Thornton2019Helios:Clouds,Himmel2013Helios+Humans}. While inter-batch variability existed, the relative positions of four clusters within the Helios$^+$ subset was conserved (Figure \ref{fig:treg-batches}c). Differential expression in violin plots revealed variation due panel design: lower CD4 fluorescence intensity for two out of three batches due to use of a different fluorochrome (Table \ref{table:panels}).

Four subsets within Helios$^+$ could be identified and gated to obtain fluorescence distributions (Figure \ref{fig:treg-discovery}b) which revealed CD45RA, CCR7, CCR4 and CD69 explain the majority of variability between clusters. We identify one naive regulatory helper phenotype (CD45RA$^+$, CCR7$^+$) and three populations showing characteristics of the memory phenotype (CD45RA$^-$, CCR7$^-$). The memory subsets can be further subdivided in a CCR4,CD69 quadrant and verified on FlowJo (Figure \ref{fig:treg-discovery}c). Two subsets were found to express CD69$^+$ --- a marker of tissue residency that promotes retention through sequestration of the \emph{sphingosine-1-phosphate} receptor \emph{S1P1} required for their egress \cite{Shiow2006CD69Organs,Kumar2017HumanSites,Sathaliyawala2013DistributionSubsets}. Dividing the embedding by tissue revealed tissue-specific enrichment patterns with blood lacking the CD69$^+$ subsets consistent with their tissue residency phenotype (Figure \ref{fig:treg-discovery}d). Lung and liver contained a high proportion of regulatory helpers expressing the chemokine receptor CCR4$^+$. CCR4 has been reported to play an important role in T cell trafficking to the lung \cite{Mikhak2013LungCCR4} and in the infiltration of regulatory helpers into tumours \cite{Bromley2008OrchestratingTraffic}. This iterative discovery loop can be performed for any other population of interest, as shown for the Th1 and cytotoxic memory phenotypes (Figures \ref{fig:th1}--\ref{fig:cd8}).

\subsection{Th1 Helper Subsets}
The Th1 helper cells prime the immune response against intracellular microorganisms including, viruses, intracellular bacteria, and some intracellular parasites. This is done by the secretion of cytokines, small protein mediators that activate and recruit macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to target cells that have been identified to be the site of infection.

\begin{Figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{th1}
    \caption{\textbf{a} Estimating the local principal axes in the embedding for Th1 helper subsets. \textbf{b} Fluorescence distributions within gates reveal correlations}
    \label{fig:th1}
\end{Figure}

An exploratory analysis of Th1 helper subsets reveals that the population distribution is supported on a simplex, whose principal axes can be constructed from correlations between fluorescence channels (Figure \ref{fig:th1}). Cells characterised by the co-expression of CD69 and CD127 are lacking blood, consistent with tissue residency.

\subsection{Cytotoxic Memory Subsets}

Exploratory analysis of the CD8\textsuperscript{+} T cell population. FlowAtlas-generated embedding of CD8\textsuperscript{+} subset from all tissues of donors in Panel C, as defined by the initial FlowJo gating strategy, were coloured by memory and naive subpopulations as well as by heatmaps of CD103 and CD69 expression and displayed as composite embedding and as tissue specific embeddings. ROIs were drawn around four of many potential subclusters in the composite embedding to auto-generate subcluster specific violin plots of marker expression. As can be seen, naive CD8 cells were absent from the liver, lung and spleen. CM CD8 cells were mainly present in the blood, spleen and lymph nodes, as expected. Liver was dominated by cells with a TEMRA phenotype, and lung and ileum by EM CD8 cells. In keeping with its role in tissue retention, CD69\textsuperscript{+} CD8 cells were largely absent from blood but present in tissues. Although few cells were obtained from the ileum, they nearly all co-expressed CD69 and the integrin CD103 as has been described \cite{Kumar2017HumanSites,Sathaliyawala2013DistributionSubsets,Booth2014CharacterizationElderly}

\section{Discussion}
\label{exploring:discussion}
In conclusion, FlowAtlas brings a new iterative analysis concept to biomedical scientists by linking the familiar FlowJo workflow with a high-performance machine learning framework in a fully graphical, interactive environment. FlowAtlas allows rapid computation of embedding of millions of high-dimensional events on an average laptop without the need for down-sampling. The resulting embedding is highly interactive, offering zooming to explore deeper cluster structures, colouring and filtering of embedded events by custom conditions, the generation frequency statistics and the drawing of gates directly in the embedding for comparative analysis of marker expression. Moreover, state-of-the-art missing data handling methods enable concomitant cross-study analysis of datasets with non-identical panel designs or marker numbers. Findings can be immediately validated in FlowJo in an iterative discovery loop with FlowAtlas simplifying the identification and validation of rare or novel cell populations, which are more likely to be detected in the absence of down-sampling. FlowAtlas aims to strengthen the open-source collaborations between researchers using flow cytometry and the rapidly growing scientific machine learning community in Julia programming language.

\section{Methods}
\label{exploring:methods}

\subsection{Tissue Acquisition \& Dissociation} 

All samples were collected via the \href{https://www.cbtm.group.cam.ac.uk}{Cambridge Biorepository for Translational Medicine} under Research Ethics Committee approval 15/EE/0152. Tissue was obtained from five deceased organ donors following circulatory death. Donor metadata is given in Table \ref{table:donors}. Briefly, following cessation of circulatory function donors proceeded to organ donation. Organs were perfused \emph{in situ} with cold organ preservation solution and cooled with topical application of ice. Samples for the study were obtained within 60 minutes of cessation of circulation and placed in University of Wisconsin organ preservation solution for transport at 4°C to the laboratory. Lung and liver samples were obtained from the left lower lobe of the lung and the right lobe of the liver. In addition, two donor-matched blood samples were collected prior to withdrawal of life support, under approval 97/290.

To minimise the possibility of processing-depended differences in cell surface marker expression, all samples, including blood, were processed using enzymatic digestion protocol. Briefly, solid tissues were weighed, transferred into 10cm tissue culture dishes and cut into small pieces. Up to 5g of tissue was then transferred to each of eight GentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 5mL of dissociation media composed of X-vivo15 supplemented with 0.13U/mL Liberase TL (Roche), 10U/mL Benzonase nuclease (Millipore/Merck), 2\% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), penicillin (100 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and 10mM HEPES (Sigma Aldrich). The samples were then dissociated on a GentleMACS Octo dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) running a protocol that provided gradual ramping up of homogenisation speed and two 15 minute heating/mixing steps at 37°C. Digested tissue was passed through a 70$\mu$m MACS Smartstrainer (Miltenyi Biotec) and the flow-through was first washed with media supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and then with PBS. Mononuclear cells were enriched by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density centrifugation according to manufacturer's instructions. Following, density centrifugation, mononuclear layer was collected, washed once with PBS and cell pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 2.5$\%$ FBS).

Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples were first subjected to Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation, according to manufacturer's instructions, the mononuclear layer was then collected, washed with PBS and cells were treated with the same dissociation media as solid tissues for 30 min at 37°C prior to washing and resuspension in FACS buffer.

\subsection{Flow Cytometry}

Depending on the cell yield, up to 1x10\textsuperscript{6} mononuclear cells/tissue were stained with antibodies shown in Extended Data Table \ref{table:panel}. Not all donors were stained with the same panel. To expand total number of markers, sentinel panel design was implemented where CD3 and IgD were detected with antibodies conjugated to BUV395 and Foxp3 and IgM were detected with antibodies conjugated to PE in some donors. Refer to Extended Data Table \ref{table:panels} for details. 

Single cell suspensions were washed once in PBS, transferred into 96 v-bottom plate and stained with Zombie UV viability dye for 30 min at 4°C following by a wash with FACS buffer. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50$\mu$l FACS buffer with Human FcR block (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Next, cells were pelleted, excess buffer removed and 100$\mu$l of antibody master mix composed of cell-surface antibody cocktail (see Table \ref{table:panels}), BV buffer (BD) and True-Stain Monocyte Blocker (Biolegend) and incubated for 1h at 4°C. Following incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and prepared for intracellular staining using transcription factor fixation/permeabilisation kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following IC staining, cell were resuspended in PBS and analysed on BD FACSymphony A3 cell analyser within 10 hours.
