\section{Retrospectives}

In this thesis we explored the relationship between an organism phenotype and bifurcations in differential equations models seeking to model the organism behaviour. In the collaboration in synthetic biology in chapter \ref{chapter:double-exclusive}, the experimental design goals were to engineer a particular phenotypic behaviour of \emph{E. coli}. This amounted to designing particular bifurcations in the corresponding differential equation model. A gap in machine learning methods for differential equations that optimise with respect to targets directly in state space was identified, leading to the proposed method in Chapter \ref{chapter:inference}. We laid the foundations for methods that learn differential equation models that match qualitative behaviours and high-level constraints in state space. With this new method now in hand, we revisit how the collaboration in synthetic biology would have benefited and propose a \emph{Design-Learn} workflow that we argue would benefit any collaboration which designs phenotypes by iterative genetic manipulation of an organism \cite{Dalchau2018}. Differential equation models for an organism behaviour are not always available, as in the collaboration in immunology in chapter \ref{chapter:exploring}. We outlined the importance of interactive exploration and refinement of annotations of high-dimensional data clouds and built \emph{FlowAtlas.jl} to enable immunophenotyping across datasets with heterogeneous experimental designs. Our retrospectives are concluded with a vision of how methods from chapter \ref{chapter:exploring} can be used together with our proposed \emph{Design-Learn} workflow to organise and reduce different models of organisms whose behaviours can be experimentally captured with flow cytometry.

\subsection{A \emph{Design-Learn} workflow for synthetic biology}

One of the main insights from our collaboration in synthetic biology is the importance of the representation of the observed data in tuning the learned aspects of a hypothesis. The data representation must be invariant under  transformations that we do not want to learn. When engineering \emph{E. coli} we did not care about timescales or dynamical transients in the organisms response to experimental inputs. We also did not care about the exact concentrations of fluorescent proteins at steady state. The main concern was designing the shape of the bistable region in the experimental inputs.

This motivates processing flow cytometry data using basis function methods (Section \ref{section:basis-function-methods}) and running co-dimension two continuation methods to extract the limit curve that defines the separatrix between monostable and bistable regions in state space. The limit curve tells us where the steady state manifold folds, and can then be used as target data $\targets$ to infer parameters $\theta$ of some hypothesis $\rates$ using the method in Chapter \ref{chapter:inference}. Alternatively, one optimise $\theta$ with respect to a geometric cost \eqref{eq:geometric-cost} that compares the field estimated from data $F$ to some parametrised hypothesis $\rates$. While kinetic information is ignored in this method, modes in the fluorescence distributions in the flow cytometry data define the locations of fixed points, and hence the shape of the steady state manifold. Whether design goals involve the whole shape of the steady state manifold or just its fold locations, a non-parametric representation $F$ of the data is required. Once the optimal parameters $\theta^*$ are obtained, the experimentalist can explore the neighbourhood of $\theta^*$ and see how they can change the bistable region, or whether they are close to another bifurcation which would produce a new phenotype. This can lead to new experiments that change the genotype $\theta^*+\Delta\theta$ in attempts to produce new phenotypes. Changes in genotype can involve promoter engineering for modulating transcription rates \cite{}, using degradation tags to change degradation rates \cite{} or ribosome binding site engineering for controlling translation \cite{}. The new data in turn can be used to refine the hypothesis; a summary of such a \emph{Design-Learn} pipeline is presented in Figure \ref{fig:deisgn-learn}.

Non-parametric estimates of the field $F(u,p)$ yield state space geometry from cytometry data. A parametrised hypothesis $\rates(u,p)$ is then optimised against the data-driven state space geometry, to obtain optimal parameters $\theta^*$. The neighbourhood of $\theta^*$ is then investigated to decide which genetic modifications lead to improved designs, which are then tested with subsequent collection of more cytometry data.}

\end{Figure}
Approaches that do not require a non-parametric field $F$ to obtain target bifurcations $\targets$ involve quantifying the variance around clusters in the flow cytometry data. In the vicinity of bifurcations we expect certain scaling laws to emerge (Section \ref{section:fluctuations}) and localising bifurcations would require identifying such laws. A simple approach to this would be to localise cluster splitting, which was explored in Chapter \ref{chapter:double-exclusive} but never used to produce targets $\targets$ for optimisation. Accurate localisation of bifurcations using these methods require fine experimental sampling along the control condition $p$ and can ultimately be limited by intrinsic noise in the organism.

\subsection{Bifurcations \& model reduction}

\emph{E. col} is a relatively simple organism whose genetic components can be individually modelled with biochemically reasonable assumptions and catalogued in a library of parts. This is not the case for the human immune system which was explored in chapter \ref{chapter:exploring}.
