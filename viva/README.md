# Inference of Bifurcations Between Phenotypes

This is an interactive presentation in Julia that utilises the package [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). Once installed, run Pluto with the following commands in your REPL:

```julia
julia> import Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```

Pluto will open in your browser. From there then you can open `presentation.jl`. Be patient while the package manager and JIT compiler get everything set up for you. Once loaded, set your browser to full screen and click on the **Presentation Mode** button that appears at the top of the notebook.
